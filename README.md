To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

3. Open the terminal and run the following command:
   
   ```
   npx expo start
   ```
   
   Choose the web option and the project should open in your browser.

4. If there's an error about expo and SDK dependencies, type into the terminal:
   
   ```
   npm install expo
   ```
   
   and redo step 3.

The running app should display a template with a navigation bar, where teams can add their own tab with their appropriate feature and start working on it.
